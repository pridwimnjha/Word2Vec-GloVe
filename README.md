# NLP_Lab8_L029

## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook for an NLP lab (NLP_Lab8). It demonstrates preprocessing, word embeddings, or other NLP techniques.

## Contents

- `NLP_Lab8_L029.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook containing the code and analysis.

## Requirements

The notebook uses the following Python packages (install with pip):

```
gensim.models
gensim.models.keyedvectors
gensim.scripts.glove2word2vec
matplotlib.pyplot
sklearn.decomposition
```

## How to run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Create a virtual environment and install requirements.
3. Launch Jupyter and open `NLP_Lab8_L029.ipynb`.

Example:
```
git clone <repo-url>
cd <repo>
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt  # or install packages manually
jupyter notebook NLP_Lab8_L029.ipynb
```

## Notebook structure

- The notebook contains code cells for data loading, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.

## Key Steps (typical)

- Data loading and exploration
- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization)
- Feature extraction (Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF, Word2Vec / GloVe / FastText)
- Model training and evaluation (classification/regression)
- Visualization of results


## Results

Refer to the notebook for plots, evaluation metrics, and discussion of results.
